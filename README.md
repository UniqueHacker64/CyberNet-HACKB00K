## Introduction
This repository is a detailed guide on pentesting, covering everything from network scanning and enumeration to exploitation and privilege escalation. The notes also include practical examples for using popular tools like Nmap, Metasploit, Hydra, and more.

## Topics Covered
Here’s a brief overview of the topics included:
- **Network Services Exploitation** (e.g., SMB, FTP, SSH, HTTP)
- **Brute Force Attacks** (using Hydra and Metasploit)
- **Exploiting Vulnerabilities** (e.g., MS17-010, EternalBlue, Apache, WordPress)
- **Post-Exploitation Techniques** (privilege escalation, shell access)
- **Using Metasploit for Exploits and Auxiliary Scanning**
- **MySQL, RDP, WinRM, and more** for advanced service-specific attacks

## Tools & Techniques
The repository includes commands, scripts, and tips for:
- **Nmap**: Scanning for services, vulnerabilities, and versions.
- **Metasploit**: Using exploits, auxiliary modules, and post-exploitation tools.
- **Hydra**: Brute force attacks on various services like SMB, FTP, and SSH.
- **Enum4Linux**: Enumeration of SMB shares, users, and groups.
- **Smbclient**: Accessing SMB shares, downloading files, and executing commands.
- **WinRM & CrackMapExec**: Windows Remote Management attacks and exploits.
